### Intro ###
OERbit is a Drupal-based publishing platform to share
publicly licensed learning resources (OER/OCW) with the world.

### Original development ###
OERbit was built on [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) by
[Switchback](http://switchbackcms.com) and
[Open.Michigan](http://open.umich.edu) at
[the University of Michigan](http://umich.edu). The software provides
a basic set of functionality for OER/OCW publishers, including course
and resource-based navigation, flexible content hierarchies, Creative
Commons license integration, and RSS distribution, as well as RDFa
output.

### Getting started ###

### Docs ###
All documentation is located on
[the Open.Michigan wiki](http://open.umich.edu/wiki/OERbit) and will
be kept updated as new versions emerge.
