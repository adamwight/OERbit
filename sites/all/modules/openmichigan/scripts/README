This directory contains some convenience scripts.

At present, we have:

db_cleanup.php - deletes all OER data from the OERbit DB. It will
delete any course, resources, images you have put up post
installation. Don't use this unless you're really sure you need to.

reset_admin_info.php - which is a very quick and easy to way to reset
the uid=1 username and password.
