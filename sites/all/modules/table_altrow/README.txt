= Table Alternate Rows =

Table Alternate Rows is an input filter that inserts even and odd classes into
user submitted tables within nodes. This allows for proper table theming to
occur while allowing users to use regular table tags and TinyMCE's editor to
create tables.

== Installation ==

Follow standard Drupal module installation procedures. Place the module in
/modules or within your site's modules directory, and enable it at
admin/build/modules. Enable the input filter at admin/settings/filters, and
ensure it doesn't conflict with any other filters.
